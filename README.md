# Eye-Exercise

Description
This project displays a web page with two eyes that follow your mouse movement. The webpage uses JavaScript to manipulate the html elements on the web page. More specifically, the mouse movement event is used to update the position of the "eye" element displayed on the page. This exercise uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create the dynamic experience.

Deployment
The solution is easy to deploy. First, download the files to your local machine and make sure they are in put into the same directory. Using a browser, simply open up the index.html file. To execute, simply move you mouse around the page to see the eyes track the cursor.

Roadmap/Improvements:
Add a function to change the color of the eyes on mouse click.
